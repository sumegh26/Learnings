    "Memory management in Python is done automatically through a system called the Python Memory Manager. This system is responsible for allocating and freeing up memory used by Python objects during runtime.\n",

    "Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of objects and their references. Each time an object is created, a reference count is assigned to it, which is incremented each time a new reference is made to the object. Similarly, each time a reference is removed, the reference count is decremented. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, it is no longer in use and is automatically deleted from memory by the Python Memory Manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a technique called garbage collection to free up memory used by objects that have circular references, where two or more objects reference each other but have no other references. The garbage collector periodically scans the memory to identify and delete such objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also provides a mechanism for managing memory manually through the use of the \"gc\" module. This module provides functions for controlling the garbage collector and manually managing memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
