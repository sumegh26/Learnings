SQL databases have a predefined schema, which means that the structure of the database is fixed and must be defined before any data can be inserted. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",

    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each record in the table. A primary key is used to enforce the integrity of the data by ensuring that each record is unique and can be easily accessed and updated. Some characteristics of primary keys are:\n",
    "A primary key cannot contain null values.\n",
    "A primary key must be unique for each record in the table.\n",

    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a database. A foreign key is used to enforce referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the column match the values of the primary key in the related table.\n",
    "For example, consider two tables called \"students\" and \"courses\". The \"students\" table has a primary key \"student_id\", and the \"courses\" table has a primary key \"course_id\". To establish a relationship between the two tables, we can create a foreign key in the \"courses\" table that references the \"student_id\" column in the \"students\" table. This would allow us to link each course to the student who is enrolled in it.\n",
